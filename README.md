# NotebookLlaMaðŸ¦™

## A fluffy and open-source alternative to NotebookLM!

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e9cca45-8a4c-4dfa-98d2-2cef147422f2

This project is aimed at producing a fully open-source, [**LlamaCloud**](https://cloud.llamaindex.ai?utm_source=demo&utm_medium=notebookLM)-backed alternative to NotebookLM.

### Prerequisites

This project uses `uv` to manage dependencies. Before you begin, make sure you have `uv` installed.

On macOS and Linux:

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

For more install options, see `uv`'s [official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Get it up and running!

Get the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/run-llama/notebookllama
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd notebookllama/
uv sync
```

Modify the `.env.example` file with your API keys:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: find it [on OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: find it [on ElevenLabs Settings](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys)
- `LLAMACLOUD_API_KEY`: find it [on LlamaCloud Dashboard](https://cloud.llamaindex.ai?utm_source=demo&utm_medium=notebookLM)

Rename the file to `.env`:

```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

Now, you will have to execute the following scripts:

```bash
uv run tools/create_llama_extract_agent.py
uv run tools/create_llama_cloud_index.py
```

And you're ready to set up the app!

Launch Postgres and Jaeger:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Run the **MCP** server:

```bash
uv run src/notebookllama/server.py
```

Now, launch the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run src/notebookllama/Home.py
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> _You might need to install `ffmpeg` if you do not have it installed already_

And start exploring the app at `http://localhost:8751/`.

### Running on Replit

To run this project on Replit:

1.  **Fork the Repl**: Click the "Run on Replit" button (if available) or import the GitHub repository directly into Replit.
2.  **Configure Secrets**:
    *   In the Replit sidebar, go to "Secrets".
    *   Add the following secrets with your API keys:
        *   `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
        *   `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: Your ElevenLabs API key.
        *   `LLAMACLOUD_API_KEY`: Your LlamaCloud API key.
3.  **Run the Project**:
    *   Click the "Run" button at the top.
    *   Replit will automatically install dependencies, run the setup scripts, start the PostgreSQL and Jaeger services using Docker Compose, start the MCP server, and then launch the Streamlit application.
    *   The application should become available in Replit's webview. You might need to open the webview in a new tab to access all features correctly.
    *   The first run might take a few minutes to set everything up.

> [!NOTE]
> The Replit environment is configured using `.replit` and `replit.nix` files. These files handle the installation of Python, `ffmpeg`, `postgresql`, and other dependencies, as well as the execution of necessary setup scripts and servers. Docker and Docker Compose are used within the Replit environment to manage services like PostgreSQL and Jaeger.
